# Word Detector
This is the word detector for the handwriting OCR

It will find the words in an image and create a cropped image for each it finds.

This will use the Python 3.6, OpenCV v3.3 library, Tesseract, and pytesseract.

To install and use Tesseract on Ubuntu, please refer [here](https://medium.com/@lucas63/installing-tesseract-3-04-in-ubuntu-14-04-1dae8b748a32)
